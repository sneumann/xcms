  (https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/issues/612).

Changes in version 3.17.5
----------------------

- Change the way the m/z value for a chromatographic peak is determined by
  centWave: if a ROI contains more than one peak for one scan (spectrum) an
  intensity-weighted m/z is reported for that scan. The m/z of the
  chromatographic peak is then calculated based on these reported m/z values for
  each scan (spectrum). In the original version the mean m/z for a scan was
  reported instead. As a result, m/z values of chromatographic peaks are now
  slightly different but are expected to be more accurate. See
  https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/issues/590 for more details.

----------------------

  `XCMSnExp` object.
- Add `plotChromatogramsOverlay` function to support plotting of multiple EICs

  with identical retention times. For `method = "matchRtime"` the (much faster)
  matching function `closest` from the `MsCoreUtils` package is used.

  perform the correlation only with values larger than this threshold

- Add `fillChromPeaks,ChromPeakAreaParam` to base the area from which missing
  peak data should be filled-in on the actually detected chromatographic peaks
  of a feature.
- Potential fix for issue #481: function should no longer throw an error because
  retention times are of length 0.

  the findChromPeaks, refineChromPeaks, reconstructChromPeakSpectra and
  chromPeakSpectra calls.


Changes in version 3.11.1

- Add quantify,XCMSnExp object to quantify an XCMSnExp into a
  SummarizedExperiment.
- Fine-tune MergeNeighboringPeaks peak refinement method: the average of the
  3 data points between candidate peaks is used to evaluate whether the peaks
  should be merged making the approach more robust against outliers. In
  addition, an ion chromatogram for candidate peaks is extracted with an m/z
  range expanded depending on the expandMz and ppm setting ensuring that low
  intensity data points between candidate peaks are not missed out (because
  their m/z might be slightly shifted on ToF instruments). The mzmin and mzmax
  of the merged peak represents also the minimum and maximum m/z of all data
  points in that extracted ion chromatogram.

  column "class" from the data.frame in the phenoData slot, or if not
  present, the interaction of all factors (columns) of that data.frame.
- The sampclass<- method replaces the content of the "class" column in
  the phenoData data.frame. If a data.frame is submitted, the interaction
  of its columns is calculated and stored into the "class" column.

  - profMethod: same functionality as the profMethod method of xcmsRaw.
  - profStep: same functionality as the profStep method of xcmsRaw.
  - scanrange: returns the value for the scanrange slot. For downstream compatibility, this method returns NULL if the object does not have the same named slot.

Changes in version 1.33.14
----------------------

+ For more details and all changes before May 2012 please see the (now discontinued) CHANGELOG in the source package (inst/ folder).

CHANGED BEHAVIOUR since Version 1.32:
----------------------

+ Other Changes since Version 1.32:

* improved mzData writing, now includes MSn spectra and less verbose.
* improved netCDF writing, but not yet good enough for AMDIS


CHANGED BEHAVIOUR since Version 1.14:
----------------------

* centWave may report a smaller set of peaks, due to a small bug
  in the ROI algorithm some features with mass deviation > ppm were retained.

+ Other Changes since Version 1.14:

* New method for grouping: an algorithm inspired by mzMine
  group(method="nearest") has been implemented. It is slower
  than group(method="density"). It can individually group
  close-eluting peaks of very similar mass

* New method for retention time correction:
  The retcor(method="obiwarp") algorithm operates on the raw data,
  and thus allows to correct runs without well-behaving
  peak groups, or without peak picking at all.

* fillPeaks(method="MSW") is now also available
  for direct infusion spectra. The findPeaks(method="MSW")
  now returns several intensities, and correctly reports
  mzmin and mzmax for peaks.

* centWave now uses dynamic memory allocation, needs much less memory,
  and these BUF related errors should be a thing of the past.

* centWave gains an optional argument "noise",
  which is useful for data that was centroided without any intensity threshold,
  centroids with intensity < "noise" are omitted from ROI detection

* the fillPeaks() methods now remember which was
  an observed, and which was a "filled" peak.

* For direct infusion spectra diffreport() now shows
  the raw peak shapes, and also indicated "real" and "filled" peaks.

* xcmsRaw can now filter for positive/negative spectra,
  if the file includes both polarities. xcmsSet() can pass
  the polarity to contain positive/negative peaks only.
