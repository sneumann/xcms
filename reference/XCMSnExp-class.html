<meta property="og:title" content="Data container storing xcms preprocessing results — XCMSnExp-class" />
<meta property="og:description" content="The XCMSnExp object is a container for the results of a G/LC-MS
data preprocessing that comprises chromatographic peak detection, alignment
and correspondence. These results can be accessed with the chromPeaks,
adjustedRtime and featureDefinitions functions; see below
(after the Usage, Arguments, Value and Slots sections) for more details).
Along with the results, the object contains the processing history that
allows to track each processing step along with the used settings. This
can be extracted with the processHistory method.
XCMSnExp objects, by directly extending the
OnDiskMSnExp object from the MSnbase package, inherit
all of its functionality and allows thus an easy access to the full raw
data at any stage of an analysis.
To support interaction with packages requiring the old objects,
XCMSnExp objects can be coerced into xcmsSet
objects using the as method (see examples below). All
preprocessing results will be passed along to the resulting
xcmsSet object.
General functions for XCMSnExp objects are (see further below for
specific function to handle chromatographic peak data, alignment and
correspondence results):
processHistoryTypes returns the available types of
    process histories. These can be passed with argument type to the
    processHistory method to extract specific process step(s).
hasFilledChromPeaks: whether filled-in peaks are present or not.
profMat: creates a profile matrix, which
    is a n x m matrix, n (rows) representing equally spaced m/z values (bins)
    and m (columns) the retention time of the corresponding scans. Each cell
    contains the maximum intensity measured for the specific scan and m/z
    values. See profMat for more details and description of
    the various binning methods.
hasAdjustedRtime: whether the object provides adjusted
retention times.
hasFeatures: whether the object contains correspondence
results (i.e. features).
hasChromPeaks: whether the object contains peak
detection results.
hasFilledChromPeaks: whether the object contains any filled-in
chromatographic peaks.
adjustedRtime,adjustedRtime&amp;lt;-:
extract/set adjusted retention times. adjustedRtime&amp;lt;- should not
be called manually, it is called internally by the
adjustRtime methods. For XCMSnExp objects,
adjustedRtime&amp;lt;- does also apply retention time adjustments to
eventually present chromatographic peaks. The bySample parameter
allows to specify whether the adjusted retention time should be grouped
by sample (file).
featureDefinitions, featureDefinitions&amp;lt;-: extract
or set the correspondence results, i.e. the mz-rt features (peak groups).
Similar to the chromPeaks it is possible to extract features for
specified m/z and/or rt ranges. The function supports also the parameter
type that allows to specify which features to be returned if any
of rt or mz is specified. For details see help of
chromPeaks.
See also featureSummary for a function to calculate simple
feature summaries.
chromPeaks, chromPeaks&amp;lt;-: extract or set
the matrix containing the information on identified chromatographic
peaks. Rownames of the matrix represent unique IDs of the respective peaks
within the experiment.
Parameter bySample allows to specify whether peaks should
be returned ungrouped (default bySample = FALSE) or grouped by
sample (bySample = TRUE). The chromPeaks&amp;lt;- method for
XCMSnExp objects removes also all correspondence (peak grouping)
and retention time correction (alignment) results. The optional
arguments rt, mz, ppm and type allow to extract
only chromatographic peaks overlapping the defined retention time and/or
m/z ranges. Argument type allows to define how overlapping is
determined: for type == &quot;any&quot; (the default), all peaks that are even
partially overlapping the region are returned, for type == &quot;within&quot;
the full peak has to be within the region and for
type == &quot;apex_within&quot; the peak's apex position (highest signal of the
peak) has to be within the region.
See description of the return value for details on the returned matrix.
Users usually don't have to use the chromPeaks&amp;lt;- method directly
as detected chromatographic peaks are added to the object by the
findChromPeaks method. Also, chromPeaks&amp;lt;- will replace
any existing chromPeakData.
chromPeakData and chromPeakData&amp;lt;- allow to get or set arbitrary
chromatographic peak annotations. These are returned or ar returned as a
DataFrame. Note that the number of rows and the rownames of the
DataFrame have to match those of chromPeaks.
rtime: extracts the retention time for each
scan. The bySample parameter allows to return the values grouped
by sample/file and adjusted whether adjusted or raw retention
times should be returned. By default the method returns adjusted
retention times, if they are available (i.e. if retention times were
adjusted using the adjustRtime method).
mz: extracts the mz values from each scan of
all files within an XCMSnExp object. These values are extracted
from the original data files and eventual processing steps are applied
on the fly. Using the bySample parameter it is possible to
switch from the default grouping of mz values by spectrum/scan to a
grouping by sample/file.
intensity: extracts the intensity values from
each scan of all files within an XCMSnExp object. These values are
extracted from the original data files and eventual processing steps are
applied on the fly. Using the bySample parameter it is
possible to switch from the default grouping of intensity values by
spectrum/scan to a grouping by sample/file.
spectra: extracts the
Spectrum objects containing all data from
object. The values are extracted from the original data files and
eventual processing steps are applied on the fly. By setting
bySample = TRUE, the spectra are returned grouped by sample/file.
If the XCMSnExp object contains adjusted retention times, these
are returned by default in the Spectrum objects (can be
overwritten by setting adjusted = FALSE).
processHistory: returns a list of
ProcessHistory objects (or objects inheriting from this
base class) representing the individual processing steps that have been
performed, eventually along with their settings (Param parameter
class). Optional arguments fileIndex, type and
msLevel allow to restrict to process steps of a certain type or
performed on a certain file or MS level.
dropChromPeaks: drops any identified chromatographic
peaks and returns the object without that information. Note that for
XCMSnExp objects the method drops by default also results from a
correspondence (peak grouping) analysis. Adjusted retention times are
removed if the alignment has been performed after peak detection.
This can be overruled with keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE.
dropFeatureDefinitions: drops the results from a
correspondence (peak grouping) analysis, i.e. the definition of the mz-rt
features and returns the object without that information. Note that for
XCMSnExp objects the method will also by default drop retention
time adjustment results, if these were performed after the last peak
grouping (i.e. which base on the results from the peak grouping that are
going to be removed). All related process history steps are
removed too as well as eventually filled in peaks
(by fillChromPeaks). The parameter keepAdjustedRtime
can be used to avoid removal of adjusted retention times.
dropAdjustedRtime: drops any retention time
adjustment information and returns the object without adjusted retention
time. For XCMSnExp objects, this also reverts the retention times
reported for the chromatographic peaks in the peak matrix to the
original, raw, ones (after chromatographic peak detection). Note that
for XCMSnExp objects the method drops also all peak grouping
results if these were performed after the retention time
adjustment. All related process history steps are removed too.
findChromPeaks performs chromatographic peak detection
on the provided XCMSnExp objects. For more details see the method
for XCMSnExp.
Note that by default (with parameter add = FALSE) previous peak
detection results are removed. Use add = TRUE to perform a second
round of peak detection and add the newly identified peaks to the previous
peak detection results. Correspondence results (features) are always removed
prior to peak detection. Previous alignment (retention
time adjustment) results are kept, i.e. chromatographic peak detection
is performed using adjusted retention times if the data was first
aligned using e.g. obiwarp (adjustRtime-obiwarp).
dropFilledChromPeaks: drops any filled-in chromatographic
peaks (filled in by the fillChromPeaks method) and all
related process history steps.
spectrapply applies the provided function to each
Spectrum in the object and returns its
results. If no function is specified the function simply returns the
list of Spectrum objects.
XCMSnExp objects can be combined with the c function. This
combines identified chromatographic peaks and the objects' pheno data but
discards alignment results or feature definitions.
plot plots the spectrum data (see plot for
MSnExp objects in the MSnbase package for more details.
For type = &quot;XIC&quot;, identified chromatographic peaks will be indicated
as rectangles with border color peakCol." />
