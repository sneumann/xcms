\usage{
imputeRowMinRand(
  x,
  method = c("mean_sd", "from_to"),
  min_fraction = 1/2,
  min_fraction_from = 1/1000,
  sd_fraction = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{matrix} with abundances, rows being features/metabolites and
columns samples.}

\item{method}{method \code{character(1)} defining the imputation method.
See description for details. Defaults to \code{method = "mean_sd"}.}

\item{min_fraction}{\code{numeric(1)} with the fraction of the row minimum that
should be used to replace \code{NA} values in that row in case that \code{mean_sd}
method is specified. When  using \code{from_to} method, this value will be the
one used to calculate the maximum value for replace \code{NA} values in that row.}

\item{min_fraction_from}{\code{numeric(1)} with the fraction of the row minimum
that should be used to calculate the minimum value for replace \code{NA} values
in that row. This parameter is used only in case that \code{from_to} method is
specified.}

\item{sd_fraction}{\code{numeric(1)} factor to reduce the estimated standard
deviation. This parameter is used only in case that \code{mean_sd} method is
specified.}

\item{abs}{\code{logical(1)} to force imputed values to be strictly positive.}
}
\description{
Replace missing values with random numbers.
When using the \code{method = "mean_sd"}, random numbers will be generated
from a normal distribution based
on (a fraction of) the row min and a standard deviation estimated from the
linear relationship between row standard deviation and mean of the full data
set. Parameter \code{sd_fraction} allows to further reduce the estimated
standard deviation.
When using the method \code{method = "from_to"}, random numbers between 2 specific values
will be generated.
}
\details{
For method \strong{mean_sd}, imputed
values are taken from a normal distribution with mean being a
user defined fraction of the row minimum and the standard deviation
estimated for that mean based on the linear relationship between row
standard deviations and row means in the full matrix \code{x}.

To largely avoid imputed values being negative or larger than the \emph{real}
values, the standard deviation for the random number generation is estimated
ignoring the intercept of the linear model estimating the relationship
between standard deviation and mean. If \code{abs = TRUE} \code{NA} values are
replaced with the absolute value of the random values.

For method \strong{from_to}, imputed values are taken between 2 user defined
fractions of the row minimum.
