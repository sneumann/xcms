\title{Correspondence: Chromatographic peak grouping methods.}
\description{
The \code{groupChromPeaks} method(s) perform the correspondence,
    i.e. the grouping of chromatographic peaks within and between samples.
    These methods are part of the modernized \code{xcms} user interface.
    The resulting peak groups are referred to as (mz-rt) features and can be
    accessed \emph{via} the \code{\link{featureDefinitions}} method on the
    result object.

    The implemented peak grouping methods are:
    \describe{

    \item{density}{peak grouping based on time dimension peak densities.
    See \code{\link{groupChromPeaks-density}} for more details.}

    \item{mzClust}{high resolution peak grouping for single spectra (direct
    infusion) MS data. See \code{\link{groupChromPeaks-mzClust}} for more
    details.}

    \item{nearest}{chromatographic peak grouping based on their proximity in
    the mz-rt space. See \code{\link{groupChromPeaks-nearest}} for more
    details.}

}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{featureDefinitions}} and
\code{\link{featureValues,XCMSnExp-method}} for methods to access peak
grouping results.

\code{\link{featureChromatograms}} to extract ion chromatograms for each
feature.

\code{\link{group}} for the \emph{old} peak grouping methods.
