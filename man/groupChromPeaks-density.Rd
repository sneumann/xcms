\arguments{
\item{sampleGroups}{A vector of the same length than samples defining the
sample group assignments (i.e. which samples belong to which sample
group). This parameter is mandatory for the \code{PeakDensityParam}
and has to be provided also if there is no sample grouping in the
experiment (in which case all samples should be assigned to the
same group).}

\item{bw}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the bandwidth (standard deviation ot the
smoothing kernel) to be used. This argument is passed to the
[density() method.}

\item{minFraction}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the minimum fraction of samples
in at least one sample group in which the peaks have to be present to be
considered as a peak group (feature).}

\item{minSamples}{\code{numeric(1)} with the minimum number of samples in at
least one sample group in which the peaks have to be detected to be
considered a peak group (feature).}

\item{binSize}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the size of the overlapping slices
in mz dimension.}

\item{maxFeatures}{\code{numeric(1)} with the maximum number of peak groups
to be identified in a single mz slice.}

\item{object}{For \code{groupChromPeaks}: an \link{XCMSnExp} object
containing the results from a previous peak detection analysis (see
\code{\link[=findChromPeaks]{findChromPeaks()}}).\preformatted{For all other methods: a `PeakDensityParam` object.
}}

\item{value}{The value for the slot.}

\item{param}{A \code{PeakDensityParam} object containing all settings for
the peak grouping algorithm.}

\item{msLevel}{\code{integer(1)} (default \code{msLevel = 1L}) defining the MS level
on which the correspondence should be performed. It is required that
chromatographic peaks of the respective MS level are present.}

\item{add}{\code{logical(1)} (default \code{add = FALSE}) allowing to perform an
additional round of correspondence (e.g. on a different MS level) and
add features to the already present feature definitions.}
}
\value{
The \code{PeakDensityParam} function returns a
\code{PeakDensityParam} class instance with all of the settings
specified for chromatographic peak alignment based on peak densities.
Note that argument \code{sampleGroups} is mandatory and should represent
either the sample grouping in the experiment. It's length has to match
the number of sample in the experiments.

For \code{groupChromPeaks}: a \link{XCMSnExp} object with the
results of the correspondence analysis. The definition of the resulting
mz-rt features can be accessed with the \code{\link[=featureDefinitions]{featureDefinitions()}} method
}
\description{
This method performs performs correspondence (chromatographic
peak grouping) based on the density (distribution) of identified peaks
along the retention time axis within slices of overlapping mz ranges.
All peaks (from the same or from different samples) being close on the
retention time axis are grouped into a feature (\emph{peak group}).

The \code{PeakDensityParam} class allows to specify all settings for the peak
grouping based on peak densities along the time dimension. Instances should
be created with the \code{\link[=PeakDensityParam]{PeakDensityParam()}} constructor.

\code{sampleGroups},\verb{sampleGroups<-}: getter and setter
for the \code{sampleGroups} slot of the object. Its length should match
the number of samples in the experiment and it should not contain
\code{NA}s.

\code{bw},\verb{bw<-}: getter and setter for the \code{bw} slot
of the object.

\code{minFraction},\verb{minFraction<-}: getter and setter for
the \code{minFraction} slot of the object.

\code{minSamples},\verb{minSamples<-}: getter and setter for the
\code{minSamples} slot of the object.

\code{binSize},\verb{binSize<-}: getter and setter for the
\code{binSize} slot of the object.

\code{maxFeatures},\verb{maxFeatures<-}: getter and setter for
the \code{maxFeatures} slot of the object.

\verb{groupChromPeaks,XCMSnExp,PeakDensityParam}:
performs correspondence (peak grouping within and across samples) within
in mz dimension overlapping slices of MS data based on the density
distribution of the identified chromatographic peaks in the slice along
the time axis.

The correspondence analysis can be performed on chromatographic peaks of
any MS level (if present and if chromatographic peak detection has been
performed for that MS level) defining features combining these peaks. The
MS level can be selected with the parameter \code{msLevel}. By default, calling
\code{groupChromPeaks} will remove any previous correspondence results. This can
be disabled with \code{add = TRUE}, which will add newly defined features to
already present feature definitions.
