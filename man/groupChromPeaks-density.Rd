\arguments{
\item{sampleGroups}{A vector of the same length than samples defining the
sample group assignments (i.e. which samples belong to which sample
group). This parameter is mandatory for the \code{PeakDensityParam}
and has to be provided also if there is no sample grouping in the
experiment (in which case all samples should be assigned to the
same group).}

\item{bw}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the bandwidth (standard deviation ot the
smoothing kernel) to be used. This argument is passed to the
\code{\link{density}} method.}

\item{minFraction}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the minimum fraction of samples
in at least one sample group in which the peaks have to be present to be
considered as a peak group (feature).}

\item{minSamples}{\code{numeric(1)} with the minimum number of samples in at
least one sample group in which the peaks have to be detected to be
considered a peak group (feature).}

\item{binSize}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the size of the overlapping slices
in mz dimension.}

\item{maxFeatures}{\code{numeric(1)} with the maximum number of peak groups
to be identified in a single mz slice.}

\item{object}{For \code{groupChromPeaks}: an \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object
    containing the results from a previous peak detection analysis (see
    \code{\link{findChromPeaks}}).

    For all other methods: a \code{PeakDensityParam} object.}

\item{value}{The value for the slot.}

\item{param}{A \code{PeakDensityParam} object containing all settings for
the peak grouping algorithm.}
}
\value{
The \code{PeakDensityParam} function returns a
    \code{PeakDensityParam} class instance with all of the settings
    specified for chromatographic peak alignment based on peak densities.
    Note that argument `sampleGroups` is mandatory and should represent
    either the sample grouping in the experiment. It's length has to match
    the number of sample in the experiments.

For \code{groupChromPeaks}: a \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object with the
results of the correspondence analysis. The definition of the resulting
mz-rt features can be accessed with the \code{\link{featureDefinitions}}
method.
}
\description{
This method performs performs correspondence (chromatographic
    peak grouping) based on the density (distribution) of identified peaks
    along the retention time axis within slices of overlapping mz ranges.
    All peaks (from the same or from different samples) being close on the
    retention time axis are grouped into a feature (\emph{peak group}).

The \code{PeakDensityParam} class allows to specify all
    settings for the peak grouping based on peak densities along the time
    dimension. Instances should be created with the \code{PeakDensityParam}
    constructor.

\code{sampleGroups},\code{sampleGroups<-}: getter and setter
    for the \code{sampleGroups} slot of the object. Its length should match
    the number of samples in the experiment and it should not contain
    \code{NA}s.

\code{bw},\code{bw<-}: getter and setter for the \code{bw} slot
    of the object.

\code{minFraction},\code{minFraction<-}: getter and setter for
    the \code{minFraction} slot of the object.

\code{minSamples},\code{minSamples<-}: getter and setter for the
    \code{minSamples} slot of the object.

\code{binSize},\code{binSize<-}: getter and setter for the
    \code{binSize} slot of the object.

\code{maxFeatures},\code{maxFeatures<-}: getter and setter for
    the \code{maxFeatures} slot of the object.

\code{groupChromPeaks,XCMSnExp,PeakDensityParam}:
performs correspondence (peak grouping within and across samples) within
in mz dimension overlapping slices of MS data based on the density
distribution of the identified chromatographic peaks in the slice along
the time axis.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{.__classVersion__,sampleGroups,bw,minFraction,minSamples,binSize,maxFeatures}}{See corresponding parameter above. \code{.__classVersion__} stores
the version from the class. Slots values should exclusively be accessed
\emph{via} the corresponding getter and setter methods listed above.}
}}

\note{
These methods and classes are part of the updated and modernized
    \code{xcms} user interface which will eventually replace the
    \code{\link{group}} methods. All of the settings to the algorithm
    can be passed with a \code{PeakDensityParam} object.

Calling \code{groupChromPeaks} on an \code{XCMSnExp} object will cause
all eventually present previous correspondence results to be dropped.
