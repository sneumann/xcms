featureChromatograms(
  x,
  expandRt = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{XCMSnExp} object with grouped chromatographic peaks.}

\item{expandRt}{\code{numeric(1)} to expand the retention time range for each
chromatographic peak by a constant value on each side.}

\item{aggregationFun}{\code{character(1)} specifying the name that should be
used to aggregate intensity values across the m/z value range for
the same retention time. The default \code{"sum"} returns a base peak
chromatogram.}

\item{features}{\code{integer}, \code{character} or \code{logical} defining a subset of
features for which chromatograms should be returned. Can be the index
of the features in \code{featureDefinitions}, feature IDs (row names of
\code{featureDefinitions}) or a logical vector.}

\item{include}{\code{character(1)} defining which chromatographic peaks (and
related feature definitions) should be included in the returned
\code{\link[=XChromatograms]{XChromatograms()}}. Defaults to \code{"feature_only"}; See description above
for options and details.}

\item{filled}{\code{logical(1)} whether filled-in peaks should be included in
the result object. The default is \code{filled = FALSE}, i.e. only detected
peaks are reported.}

\item{n}{\code{integer(1)} to optionally specify the number of \emph{top n} samples
from which the EIC should be extracted.}

\item{value}{\code{character(1)} specifying the column to be used to sort the
samples. Can be either \code{"maxo"} (the default) or \code{"into"} to use the
maximal peak intensity or the integrated peak area, respectively.}

\item{expandMz}{\code{numeric(1)} to expand the m/z range for each chromatographic
peak by a constant value on each side. Be aware that by extending the
m/z range the extracted EIC might \strong{no longer} represent the actual
identified chromatographic peak because intensities of potential
additional mass peaks within each spectra would be aggregated into the
final reported intensity value per spectrum (retention time).}

\item{...}{optional arguments to be passed along to the \code{\link[=chromatogram]{chromatogram()}}
function.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=XChromatograms]{XChromatograms()}} object.
}
\description{
Extract ion chromatograms for features in an \linkS4class{XCMSnExp} object. The
function returns for each feature its extracted ion chromatogram and all
associated peaks with it. The chromatogram is extracted from the m/z - rt
region including all chromatographic peaks of that features (i.e. based on
the ranges of \code{"mzmin"}, \code{"mzmax"}, \code{"rtmin"}, \code{"rtmax"} of all
chromatographic peaks of the feature).

By default only chromatographic peaks associated with a feature are included
for an extracted ion chromatogram (parameter \code{include = "feature_only"}). By
setting \code{include = "apex_within"} all chromatographic peaks (and eventually
the feature which they are part of - if feature definitions are present)
that have their apex position within the m/z - rt range from which the
chromatogram is extracted are returned too.
With \code{include = "any"} or \code{include = "all"} all chromatographic peaks (and
eventually the feature in which they are present) overlapping the m/z and rt
range will be returned.
}
\note{
When extracting EICs from only the top \code{n} samples it can happen that one
or more of the features specified with \code{features} are dropped because they
have no detected peak in the \emph{top n} samples. The chance for this to happen
is smaller if \code{x} contains also filled-in peaks (with \code{fillChromPeaks}).
}
\examples{

## Load a test data set with detected peaks
data(faahko_sub)
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(faahko_sub) <- system.file("cdf/KO", package = "faahKO")

## Disable parallel processing for this example
register(SerialParam())

## Subset the object to a smaller retention time range
xdata <- filterRt(faahko_sub, c(2500, 3500))

xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata,
    param = PeakDensityParam(minFraction = 0.8, sampleGroups = rep(1, 3)))

## Get the feature definitions
featureDefinitions(xdata)

## Extract ion chromatograms for the first 3 features. Parameter
## `features` can be either the feature IDs or feature indices.
chrs <- featureChromatograms(xdata, features = 1:3)

## Plot the XIC for the first feature using different colors for each file
plot(chrs[1, ], col = c("red", "green", "blue"))
