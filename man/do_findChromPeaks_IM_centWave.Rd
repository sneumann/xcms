}
\arguments{
\item{ppm}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the maximal tolerated m/z deviation in
consecutive scans in parts per million (ppm) for the initial ROI
definition.}

\item{peakwidth}{\code{numeric(2)} with the expected approximate
peak width in chromatographic space. Given as a range (min, max)
in seconds.}

\item{snthresh}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the signal to noise ratio cutoff.}

\item{prefilter}{\code{numeric(2)}: \code{c(k, I)} specifying the prefilter
step for the first analysis step (ROI detection). Mass traces are only
retained if they contain at least \code{k} peaks with intensity
\code{>= I}.}

\item{mzCenterFun}{Name of the function to calculate the m/z center of the
chromatographic peak. Allowed are: \code{"wMean"}: intensity weighted
mean of the peak's m/z values, \code{"mean"}: mean of the peak's m/z
values, \code{"apex"}: use the m/z value at the peak apex,
\code{"wMeanApex3"}: intensity weighted mean of the m/z value at the
peak apex and the m/z values left and right of it and \code{"meanApex3"}:
mean of the m/z value of the peak apex and the m/z values left and right
of it.}

\item{integrate}{Integration method. For \code{integrate = 1} peak limits
are found through descent on the mexican hat filtered data, for
\code{integrate = 2} the descent is done on the real data. The latter
method is more accurate but prone to noise, while the former is more
robust, but less exact.}

\item{mzdiff}{\code{numeric(1)} representing the minimum difference in m/z
dimension required for peaks with overlapping retention times; can be
negative to allow overlap. During peak post-processing, peaks
defined to be overlapping are reduced to the one peak with the largest
signal.}

\item{fitgauss}{\code{logical(1)} whether or not a Gaussian should be fitted
to each peak. This affects mostly the retention time position of the
peak.}

\item{noise}{\code{numeric(1)} allowing to set a minimum intensity required
for centroids to be considered in the first analysis step (centroids with
intensity \code{< noise} are omitted from ROI detection).}

\item{verboseColumns}{\code{logical(1)} whether additional peak meta data
columns should be returned.}

\item{roiList}{An optional list of regions-of-interest (ROI) representing
detected mass traces. If ROIs are submitted the first analysis step is
omitted and chromatographic peak detection is performed on the submitted
ROIs. Each ROI is expected to have the following elements specified:
\code{scmin} (start scan index), \code{scmax} (end scan index),
\code{mzmin} (minimum m/z), \code{mzmax} (maximum m/z), \code{length}
(number of scans), \code{intensity} (summed intensity). Each ROI should
be represented by a \code{list} of elements or a single row
\code{data.frame}.}

\item{firstBaselineCheck}{\code{logical(1)}. If \code{TRUE} continuous
data within regions of interest is checked to be above the first baseline.
In detail, a first rough estimate of the noise is calculated and peak
detection is performed only in regions in which multiple sequential
signals are higher than this first estimated baseline/noise level.}

\item{roiScales}{Optional numeric vector with length equal to \code{roiList}
defining the scale for each region of interest in \code{roiList} that
should be used for the centWave-wavelets.}

\item{sleep}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the number of seconds to wait between
iterations. Defaults to \code{sleep = 0}. If \code{> 0} a plot is
generated visualizing the identified chromatographic peak. Note: this
argument is for backward compatibility only and will be removed in
future.}

\item{extendLengthMSW}{Option to force centWave to use all scales when
running centWave rather than truncating with the EIC length. Uses the "open"
method to extend the EIC to a integer base-2 length prior to being passed to
\code{convolve} rather than the default "reflect" method. See
https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/issues/445 for more information.}

\item{ppmMerging}{The maximum mass deviation allowed when grouping individual
IM scans into frames. Data points within \code{ppmMerging} ppm will be
summed up into a single value and the reported mz will be their weighted
average.}

\item{binWidthIM}{The bin size used when calculating the mobilograms to resolve
the peaks into the ion-mobility dimension. Lower values will give better resolution
if the data allows it, but can also generate spurious peaks.}
}
\value{
A matrix, each row representing an identified peak, with columns:
    \describe{
    \item{mz}{m/z value of the peak at the apex position.}
    \item{mzmin}{Minimum m/z of the peak.}
    \item{mzmax}{Maximum m/z of the peak.}
    \item{rt}{Retention time value of the peak at the apex position.}
    \item{rtmin}{Minimum retention time of the peak.}
    \item{rtmax}{Maximum retention time of the peak.}
    \item{im}{Ion mobility value of the peak at the apex position.}
    \item{immin}{Minimum ion mobility value of the peak.}
    \item{immax}{Maximum ion mobility value of the peak.}
    \item{maxo}{Maximum intensity of the peak.}
    \item{into}{Integrated (original) intensity of the peak.}
    \item{intb}{Always \code{NA}.}
    \item{sn}{Always \code{NA}}
    }
}
\description{
Performs an extension of CentWave peak-picking on LC-IM-MS MS1
  data. First it joins all scans into frames and performs .centWave_orig on
  the summarized LC-MS-like data. From each peak, it calculates its mobilogram and
  performs a second peak-picking on the IM dimension, resolving the peaks.
