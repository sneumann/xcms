\usage{
\S4method{plotChromPeakDensity}{XCMSnExp}(
  object,
  mz,
  rt,
  param,
  simulate = TRUE,
  col = "#00000080",
  xlab = "retention time",
  ylab = "sample",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \link{XCMSnExp} object with identified
chromatographic peaks.}

\item{mz}{\code{numeric(2)} defining an mz range for which the peak density
should be plotted.}

\item{rt}{\code{numeric(2)} defining an optional rt range for which the
peak density should be plotted. Defaults to the absolute retention time
range of \code{object}.}

\item{param}{\link{PeakDensityParam} from which parameters for the
\emph{peak density} correspondence algorithm can be extracted. If not provided
and if \code{object} contains feature definitions with the correspondence/
peak grouping being performed by the \emph{peak density} method, the
corresponding parameter class stored in \code{object} is used.}

\item{simulate}{\code{logical(1)} defining whether correspondence should be
simulated within the specified m/z / rt region or (with
\code{simulate = FALSE}) whether the results from an already performed
correspondence should be shown.}

\item{col}{Color to be used for the individual samples. Length has to be 1
or equal to the number of samples in \code{object}.}

\item{xlab}{\code{character(1)} with the label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{\code{character(1)} with the label for the y-axis.}

\item{xlim}{\code{numeric(2)} representing the limits for the x-axis.
Defaults to the range of the \code{rt} parameter.}

\item{main}{\code{character(1)} defining the title of the plot. By default
(for \code{main = NULL}) the mz-range is used.}

\item{type}{\code{character(1)} specifying how peaks are called to be located
within the region defined by \code{mz} and \code{rt}. Can be one of \code{"any"},
\code{"within"}, and \code{"apex_within"} for all peaks that are even partially
overlapping the region, peaks that are completely within the region, and
peaks for which the apex is within the region. This parameter is passed
to the \link{chromPeaks} function. See related documentation for more
information and examples.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed to the \code{plot} function. Data
point specific parameters such as \code{bg} or \code{pch} have to be of length 1
or equal to the number of samples.}
}
\value{
The function is called for its side effect, i.e. to create a plot.

\description{
Plot the density of chromatographic peaks along the retention
time axis and indicate which peaks would be (or were) grouped into the
same feature based using the \emph{peak density} correspondence method.
Settings for the \emph{peak density} method can be passed with an
\link{PeakDensityParam} object to parameter \code{param}. If the \code{object} contains
correspondence results and the correspondence was performed with the
\emph{peak groups} method, the results from that correspondence can be
visualized setting \code{simulate = FALSE}.
}
\details{
The \code{plotChromPeakDensity} function allows to evaluate
different settings for the \emph{peak density} on an mz slice of
interest (e.g. containing chromatographic peaks corresponding to a known
metabolite).
The plot shows the individual peaks that were detected within the
specified \code{mz} slice at their retention time (x-axis) and sample in
which they were detected (y-axis). The density function is plotted as a
black line. Parameters for the \code{density} function are taken from the
\code{param} object. Grey rectangles indicate which chromatographic peaks
would be grouped into a feature by the \verb{peak density} correspondence
method. Parameters for the algorithm are also taken from \code{param}.
See \code{\link[=groupChromPeaks-density]{groupChromPeaks-density()}} for more information about the
algorithm and its supported settings.

## Load a test data set with detected peaks
data(faahko_sub)
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(faahko_sub) <- system.file("cdf/KO", package = "faahKO")

## Plot the chromatographic peak density for a specific mz range to evaluate
## different peak density correspondence settings.
mzr <- c(305.05, 305.15)

plotChromPeakDensity(faahko_sub, mz = mzr, pch = 16,
