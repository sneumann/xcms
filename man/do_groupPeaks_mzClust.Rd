\title{Core API function for peak grouping using mzClust}
\usage{
do_groupPeaks_mzClust(
  peaks,
  sampleGroups,
  ppm = 20,
  absMz = 0,
  minFraction = 0.5,
  minSamples = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{A \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} with the mz values and
retention times of the identified chromatographic peaks in all samples of an
experiment. Required columns are \code{"mz"}, \code{"rt"} and
\code{"sample"}. The latter should contain \code{numeric} values representing
the index of the sample in which the peak was found.}

\item{sampleGroups}{A vector of the same length than samples defining the
sample group assignments (i.e. which samples belong to which sample
group). This parameter is mandatory for the \code{PeakDensityParam}
and has to be provided also if there is no sample grouping in the
experiment (in which case all samples should be assigned to the
same group).}

\item{ppm}{\code{numeric(1)} representing the relative mz error for the
clustering/grouping (in parts per million).}

\item{absMz}{\code{numeric(1)} representing the absolute mz error for the
clustering.}

\item{minFraction}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the minimum fraction of samples
in at least one sample group in which the peaks have to be present to be
considered as a peak group (feature).}

\item{minSamples}{\code{numeric(1)} with the minimum number of samples in at
least one sample group in which the peaks have to be detected to be
considered a peak group (feature).}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with elements \code{"featureDefinitions"} and
\code{"peakIndex"}. \code{"featureDefinitions"} is a \code{matrix}, each row
representing an (mz-rt) feature (i.e. peak group) with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"mzmed"}: median of the peaks' apex mz values.
\item \code{"mzmin"}: smallest mz value of all peaks' apex within the feature.
\item \code{"mzmax"}: largest mz value of all peaks' apex within the feature.
\item \code{"rtmed"}: always \code{-1}.
\item \code{"rtmin"}: always \code{-1}.
\item \code{"rtmax"}: always \code{-1}.
\item \code{"npeaks"}: the total number of peaks assigned to the feature. Note that
this number can be larger than the total number of samples, since
multiple peaks from the same sample could be assigned to a group.
}

\code{"peakIndex"} is a \code{list} with the indices of all peaks in a peak group in
the \code{peaks} input matrix.

The \code{do_groupPeaks_mzClust} function performs high resolution
