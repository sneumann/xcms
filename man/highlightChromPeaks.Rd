\title{Add definition of chromatographic peaks to an extracted chromatogram
    plot}
\usage{
highlightChromPeaks(x, rt, mz, border = rep("00000040", length(fileNames(x))),
  lwd = 1, col = NA, type = c("rect", "point"), whichPeaks = c("any",
  "within", "apex_within"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{For \code{highlightChromPeaks}: \code{XCMSnExp} object with the
detected peaks.}

\item{rt}{For \code{highlightChromPeaks}: \code{numeric(2)} with the
retention time range from which peaks should be extracted and plotted.}

\item{mz}{\code{numeric(2)} with the mz range from which the peaks should
be extracted and plotted.}

\item{border}{colors to be used to color the border of the rectangles. Has to
be equal to the number of samples in \code{x}.}

\item{lwd}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the width of the line/border.}

\item{col}{For \code{highlightChromPeaks}: color to be used to fill the
rectangle.}

\item{type}{the plotting type. See \code{\link{plot}} in base grapics for
more details.
For \code{highlightChromPeaks}: \code{character(1)} defining how the peak
should be highlighted: \code{type = "rect"} draws a rectangle
representing the peak definition, \code{type = "point"} indicates a
chromatographic peak with a single point at the position of the peak's
\code{"rt"} and \code{"maxo"}.}

\item{whichPeaks}{\code{character(1)} specifying how peaks are called to be
located within the region defined by \code{mz} and \code{rt}. Can be
one of \code{"any"}, \code{"within"}, and \code{"apex_within"} for all
peaks that are even partially overlapping the region, peaks that are
completely within the region, and peaks for which the apex is within
the region. This parameter is passed to the \code{type} argument of the
\code{\link{chromPeaks}} function. See related documentation for more
information and examples.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to the \code{\link{matplot}} or \code{plot}
function.}
}
\description{
The \code{highlightChromPeaks} function adds chromatographic
peak definitions to an existing plot, such as one created by the
\code{plot} method on a \code{\link{Chromatogram}} or
\code{\link{Chromatograms}} object.

\examples{

## Read some files from the faahKO package.
library(xcms)
library(faahKO)
faahko_3_files <- c(system.file('cdf/KO/ko16.CDF', package = "faahKO"),
                    system.file('cdf/KO/ko18.CDF', package = "faahKO"))

od <- readMSData(faahko_3_files, mode = "onDisk")

## Peak detection using the 'matchedFilter' method. Note that we are using a
## larger binSize to reduce the runtime of the example.
xod <- findChromPeaks(od, param = MatchedFilterParam(binSize = 0.3, snthresh = 20))

## Extract the ion chromatogram for one chromatographic peak in the data.
chrs <- chromatogram(xod, rt = c(2700, 2900), mz = 335)

plot(chrs)

## Extract chromatographic peaks for the mz/rt range (if any).
chromPeaks(xod, rt = c(2700, 2900), mz = 335)

## Highlight the chromatographic peaks in the area
highlightChromPeaks(xod, rt = c(2700, 2900), mz = 335)
