\title{Core API function for peak density based chromatographic peak
grouping}
\usage{
do_groupChromPeaks_density(
  peaks,
  sampleGroups,
  bw = 30,
  minFraction = 0.5,
  minSamples = 1,
  binSize = 0.25,
  maxFeatures = 50,
  sleep = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{A \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} with the mz values and
retention times of the identified chromatographic peaks in all samples of an
experiment. Required columns are \code{"mz"}, \code{"rt"} and
\code{"sample"}. The latter should contain \code{numeric} values representing
the index of the sample in which the peak was found.}

\item{sampleGroups}{A vector of the same length than samples defining the
sample group assignments (i.e. which samples belong to which sample
group). This parameter is mandatory for the \code{PeakDensityParam}
and has to be provided also if there is no sample grouping in the
experiment (in which case all samples should be assigned to the
same group).}

\item{bw}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the bandwidth (standard deviation ot the
smoothing kernel) to be used. This argument is passed to the
[density() method.}

\item{minFraction}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the minimum fraction of samples
in at least one sample group in which the peaks have to be present to be
considered as a peak group (feature).}

\item{minSamples}{\code{numeric(1)} with the minimum number of samples in at
least one sample group in which the peaks have to be detected to be
considered a peak group (feature).}

\item{binSize}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the size of the overlapping slices
in mz dimension.}

\item{maxFeatures}{\code{numeric(1)} with the maximum number of peak groups
to be identified in a single mz slice.}

\item{sleep}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the time to \emph{sleep} between
iterations and plot the result from the current iteration.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame}, each row representing a (mz-rt) feature (i.e. a peak group)
with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"mzmed"}: median of the peaks' apex mz values.
\item \code{"mzmin"}: smallest mz value of all peaks' apex within the feature.
\item \code{"mzmax"}:largest mz value of all peaks' apex within the feature.
\item \code{"rtmed"}: the median of the peaks' retention times.
\item \code{"rtmin"}: the smallest retention time of the peaks in the group.
\item \code{"rtmax"}: the largest retention time of the peaks in the group.
\item \code{"npeaks"}: the total number of peaks assigned to the feature.
\item \code{"peakidx"}: a \code{list} with the indices of all peaks in a feature in the
\code{peaks} input matrix.
}

Note that this number can be larger than the total number of samples, since
multiple peaks from the same sample could be assigned to a feature.
}
\description{
The \code{do_groupChromPeaks_density} function performs chromatographic peak
grouping based on the density (distribution) of peaks, found in different
samples, along the retention time axis in slices of overlapping mz ranges.
}
\details{
For overlapping slices along the mz dimension, the function
calculates the density distribution of identified peaks along the
retention time axis and groups peaks from the same or different samples
that are close to each other. See (Smith 2006) for more details.
}
\note{
The default settings might not be appropriate for all LC/GC-MS setups,
especially the \code{bw} and \code{binSize} parameter should be adjusted
accordingly.

\examples{
## Load the test file
data(faahko_sub)
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(faahko_sub) <- system.file("cdf/KO", package = "faahKO")

## Disable parallel processing for this example
register(SerialParam())

## Extract the matrix with the identified peaks from the xcmsSet:
pks <- chromPeaks(faahko_sub)

## Perform the peak grouping with default settings:
res <- do_groupChromPeaks_density(pks, sampleGroups = rep(1, 3))

## The feature definitions:
head(res)
