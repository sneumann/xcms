\usage{
\S4method{featureGroups}{XCMSnExp}(object)

\S4method{featureGroups}{XCMSnExp}(object) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{\link[=XCMSnExp]{XCMSnExp()}} object.}

\item{value}{for \verb{featureGroups<-}: replacement for the feature groups in
\code{object}. Has to be of length 1 or length equal to the number of features
in \code{object}.}
}
\description{
Feature \emph{compounding} aims at identifying and grouping LC-MS features
representing different ions or adducts (including isotopes) of the same
originating compound.
The \href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/MsFeatures}{MsFeatures} package
provides a general framework and functionality to group features based on
different properties. The \code{groupFeatures} methods for \linkS4class{XCMSnExp}
objects implemented in \code{xcms} extend these to enable the \emph{compounding} of
LC-MS data. Note that these functions simply define feature groups but don't
actually \emph{aggregate} or combine the features.

See \code{\link[MsFeatures:groupFeatures]{MsFeatures::groupFeatures()}} for an overview on the general feature
grouping concept as well as details on the individual settings and
parameters.

The available options for \code{groupFeatures} on \code{xcms} preprocessing results
(i.e. on \code{XCMSnExp} objects after correspondence analysis with
\code{\link[=groupChromPeaks]{groupChromPeaks()}}) are:
\itemize{
\item Grouping by similar retention times: \code{\link[=groupFeatures-similar-rtime]{groupFeatures-similar-rtime()}}.
\item Grouping by similar feature values across samples:
\code{\link[=AbundanceSimilarityParam]{AbundanceSimilarityParam()}}.
\item Grouping by similar peak shape of extracted ion chromatograms:
\code{\link[=EicSimilarityParam]{EicSimilarityParam()}}.
}

An ideal workflow grouping features should sequentially perform the above
methods (in the listed order).

Compounded feature groups can be accessed with the \code{featureGroups} function.
