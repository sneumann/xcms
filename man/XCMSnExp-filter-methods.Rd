\title{XCMSnExp filtering and subsetting

The methods listed on this page allow to filter and subset
\code{\link{XCMSnExp}} objects. Most of them are inherited from the
\code{\link[MSnbase]{OnDiskMSnExp}} object and have been adapted for
\code{\link{XCMSnExp}} to enable subsetting also on the preprocessing
results.}
\usage{
\S4method{filterFile}{XCMSnExp}(object, file, keepAdjustedRtime = FALSE)

\S4method{filterMz}{XCMSnExp}(object, mz, msLevel., ...)

\S4method{filterRt}{XCMSnExp}(object, rt, msLevel.,
  adjusted = hasAdjustedRtime(object))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object.}

\item{file}{For \code{filterFile}: \code{integer} defining the file index
within the object to subset the object by file or \code{character} specifying
the file names to sub set. The indices are expected to be increasingly
ordered, if not they are ordered internally.}

\item{keepAdjustedRtime}{For \code{filterFile}: \code{logical(1)} defining
whether the adjusted retention times should be kept, even if features are
being removed (and the retention time correction being potentially performed
on these features).}

\item{mz}{For \code{filterMz}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the lower and upper
mz value for the filtering.}

\item{msLevel.}{For \code{filterMz}, \code{filterRt}, \code{numeric(1)}
defining the MS level(s) to which operations should be applied or to which
the object should be subsetted.}

\item{...}{Optional additional arguments.}

\item{rt}{For \code{filterRt}: \code{numeric(2)} defining the retention time
window (lower and upper bound) for the filtering.}

\item{adjusted}{For \code{filterRt}: \code{logical} indicating whether the
object should be filtered by original (\code{adjusted = FALSE}) or adjusted
retention times (\code{adjusted = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
All methods return an \code{\link{XCMSnExp}} object.
}
\description{
\code{filterFile}: allows to reduce the
\code{\link{XCMSnExp}} to data from only certain files. Identified
chromatographic peaks for these files are retained while all eventually
present features (peak grouping information) are dropped. By default also
adjusted retention times are removed. This can be overwritten by setting
\code{keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE}, but users should use this option with
caution.

\code{filterMz}: filters the data set based on the
provided mz value range. All chromatographic peaks and features (grouped
peaks) falling completely within the provided mz value range are retained
(if their minimal mz value is \code{>= mz[1]} and the maximal mz value
\code{<= mz[2]}. Adjusted retention times, if present, are not altered by
the filtering.

\code{filterRt}: filters the data set based on the
provided retention time range. All chromatographic peaks and features
(grouped peaks) the specified retention time window are retained (i.e. if
the retention time corresponding to the peak's apex is within the specified
rt range). If retention time correction has been performed, the method will
by default filter the object by adjusted retention times.
The argument \code{adjusted} allows to specify manually whether filtering
should be performed by raw or adjusted retention times. Filtering by
retention time does not drop any preprocessing results.
The method returns an empty object if no spectrum or feature is within the
specified retention time range.
}
\note{
The \code{filterFile} method removes also process history steps not
related to the files to which the object should be sub-setted and updates
the \code{fileIndex} attribute accordingly. Also, the method does not allow
arbitrary ordering of the files or re-ordering of the files within the
object.

\examples{

## Load some of the files from the faahKO package.
library(faahKO)
fs <- c(system.file('cdf/KO/ko15.CDF', package = "faahKO"),
        system.file('cdf/KO/ko16.CDF', package = "faahKO"),
        system.file('cdf/KO/ko18.CDF', package = "faahKO"))
## Read the files
od <- readMSData2(fs)

## Perform peak detection on them using default matched filter settings.
mfp <- MatchedFilterParam()
xod <- findChromPeaks(od, param = mfp)

## Subset the dataset to the first and third file.
xod_sub <- filterFile(xod, file = c(1, 3))

## The number of chromatographic peaks per file for the full object
table(chromPeaks(xod)[, "sample"])

## The number of chromatographic peaks per file for the subset
table(chromPeaks(xod_sub)[, "sample"])

basename(fileNames(xod))
basename(fileNames(xod_sub))

## Filter on mz values; chromatographic peaks and features within the
## mz range are retained (as well as adjusted retention times).
xod_sub <- filterMz(xod, mz = c(300, 400))
head(chromPeaks(xod_sub))
nrow(chromPeaks(xod_sub))
nrow(chromPeaks(xod))

## Filter on rt values. All chromatographic peaks and features within the
## retention time range are retained. Filtering is performed by default on
## adjusted retention times, if present.
xod_sub <- filterRt(xod, rt = c(2700, 2900))

range(rtime(xod_sub))
head(chromPeaks(xod_sub))
range(chromPeaks(xod_sub)[, "rt"])

nrow(chromPeaks(xod))
nrow(chromPeaks(xod_sub))
