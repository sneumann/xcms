#'
#' @description
#'
#' The `XcmsExperiment` is a data container for `xcms` preprocessing results
#' (i.e. results from chromatographic peak detection, alignment and
#' correspondence analysis).
#'
#' It provides the same functionality than the [XCMSnExp] object, but uses the
#' more advanced and modern MS infrastructure provided by the `MsExperiment`
#' and `Spectra` Bioconductor packages. With this comes a higher flexibility on
#' how and where to store the data.
#'
#' Documentation of the various functions for `XcmsExperiment` objects are
#' grouped by topic and provided in the sections below.
#'
#' The default `xcms` workflow is to perform
#'
#' - chromatographic peak detection using [findChromPeaks()]
#'
#' - optionally refine identified chromatographic peaks using
#'   [refineChromPeaks()]
#'
#' - perform an alignment (retention time adjustment) using [adjustRtime()].
#'   Depending on the method used this requires to run a correspondence
#'   analysis first
#'
#' - perform a correspondence analysis using the [groupChromPeaks()] function
#'   to group chromatographic peaks across samples to define the LC-MS
#'   features.
#'
#' - optionally perform a gap-filling to *rescue* signal in samples in which
#'   no chromatographic peak was identified and hence a missing value would
#'   be reported. This can be performed using the [fillChromPeaks()] function.
#'
#'
#' @section Subsetting and filtering:
#'
#' - `[`: subset an `XcmsExperiment` by **sample** (parameter `i`). Subsetting
#'   will by default drop correspondence results (as subsetting by samples will
#'   obviously affect the feature definition) and alignment results (adjusted
#'   retention times) while identified chromatographic peaks (for the selected
#'   samples) will be retained. Which preprocessing results should be
#'   kept or dropped can also be configured with optional parameters
#'   `keepChromPeaks` (by default `TRUE`), `keepAdjustedRtime` (by default
#'   `FALSE`) and `keepFeatures` (by default `FALSE`).
#'
#' - `filterChromPeaks`: filter chromatographic peaks of an `XcmsExperiment`
#'   keeping only those specified with parameter `keep`. Returns the
#'   `XcmsExperiment` with the filtered data. Chromatographic peaks to
#'   retain can be specified either by providing their index in the
#'   `chromPeaks` matrix, their ID (rowname in `chromPeaks`) or with a
#'   `logical` vector with the same length than number of rows of
#'   `chromPeaks`. Assignment of chromatographic peaks are updated to
#'   eventually present feature definitions after filtering.
#'
#' - `filterFeatureDefinitions`: filter feature definitions of an
#'   `XcmsExperiment` keeping only those defined with parameter `features`,
#'   which can be a `logical` of length equal to the number of features,
#'   an `integer` with the index of the features in
#'   `featureDefinitions(object)` to keep or a `character` with the feature
#'   IDs (i.e. row names in `featureDefinitions(object)`).
#'
#' - `filterFile`: filter an `XcmsExperiment` (or `MsExperiment`) by *file*
#'   (sample). The index of the samples to which the data should be subsetted
#'   can be specified with parameter `file`. The sole purpose of this function
#'   is to provide backward compatibility with the `MSnbase` package. Wherever
#'   possible, the `[` function should be used instead for any sample-based
#'   subsetting. Parameters `keepChromPeaks`, `keepAdjustedRtime` and
#'   `keepChromPeaks` can be passed using `...`.
#'   Note also that in contrast to `[`, `filterFile` does not support subsetting
#'   in arbitrary order.
#'
#' - `filterMz`, `filterMzRange`: filter the spectra within an
#'   `XcmsExperiment` or `MsExperiment` to the specified m/z range (parameter
#'   `mz`). For `XcmsExperiment` also identified chromatographic peaks and
#'   features are filtered keeping only those that are within the specified
#'   m/z range (i.e. for which the m/z of the peak apex is within the m/z
#'   range). Parameter `msLevels.` allows to restrict the filtering to
#'   only specified MS levels. By default data from all MS levels are
#'   filtered.
#'
#' - `filterRt`: filter an `XcmsExperiment` keeping only data within the
#'   specified retention time range (parameter `rt`). This function will keep
#'   all preprocessing results present within the retention time range: all
#'   identified chromatographic peaks with the retention time of the apex
#'   position within the retention time range `rt` are retained along, if
#'   present, with the associated features.
#'   Parameter `msLevel.` is currently ignored, i.e. filtering will always
#'   performed on **all** MS levels of the object.
#'
#' @section Functionality related to chromatographic peaks:
#'
#' - `chromatogram`: extract chromatographic data from a data set. Parameters
#'   `mz` and `rt` allow to define specific m/z - retention time regions to
#'   extract the data from (to e.g. for extracted ion chromatograms EICs).
#'   Both parameters are expected to be numerical two-column matrices with
#'   the first column defining the lower and the second the upper margin.
#'   Each row can define a separate m/z - retention time region. Currently
#'   the function returns a [MChromatograms()] object for `object` being a
#'   `MsExperiment` or, for `object` being an `XcmsExperiment`, either a
#'   `MChromatograms` or [XChromatograms()] depending on parameter
#'   `return.type` (can be either `"MChromatograms"` or `"XChromatograms"`).
#'   For the latter also chromatographic peaks detected within the provided
#'   m/z and retention times are returned. Parameter `chromPeaks` allows
#'   to specify which chromatographic peaks should be reported. See
#'   documentation on the `chromPeaks` parameter for more information.
#'   If the `XcmsExperiment` contains correspondence results, also the
#'   associated feature definitions will be included in the returned
#'   `XChromatograms`.
#'   Note that in future more efficient data structures for chromatographic
#'   data will be available as well.
#'
#' - `chromPeaks`: returns a `numeric` matrix with the identified
#'   chromatographic peaks. Each row represents a chromatographic peak
#'   identified in one sample (file). The number of columns depends on the
#'   peak detection algorithm (see [findChromPeaks()]) but most methods return
#'   the following columns: `"mz"` (intensity-weighted mean of the m/z values
#'   of all mass peaks included in the chromatographic peak), `"mzmin"` (
#'   smallest m/z value of any mass peak in the chromatographic peak), `"mzmax"`
#'   (largest m/z value of any mass peak in the chromatographic peak), `"rt"`
#'   (retention time of the peak apex), `"rtmin"` (retention time of the first
#'   scan/mass peak of the chromatographic peak), `"rtmax"` (retention time of
#'   the last scan/mass peak of the chromatographic peak), `"into"` (integrated
#'   intensity of the chromatographic peak), `"maxo"` (maximal intensity of any
#'   mass peak of the chromatographic peak), `"sample"` (index of the sample
#'   in `object` in which the peak was identified). Parameters `rt`, `mz`,
#'   `ppm`, `msLevel` and `type` allow to extract subsets of identified
#'   chromatographic peaks from the `object`. See parameter description below
#'   for details.
#'
#' - `chromPeakData`: returns a `DataFrame` with potential additional
#'   *annotations* for the identified chromatographic peaks. Each row in this
#'   `DataFrame` corresponds to a row (same index and row name) in the
#'   `chromPeaks` matrix. The default *annotations* are `"ms_level"` (the MS
#'   level in which the peak was identified) and `"is_filled"` (whether the
#'   chromatographic peak was *detected* (by `findChromPeaks`) or *filled-in*
#'   (by `fillChromPeaks`).
#'
#' - `chromPeakSpectra`: extract MS spectra for identified chromatographic
#'   peaks. This can be either all (full scan) MS1 spectra with retention
#'   times between the retention time range of a chromatographic peak, all
#'   MS2 spectra (if present) with a retention time within the retention
#'   time range of a (MS1) chromatographic peak and a precursor m/z within
#'   the m/z range of the chromatographic peak or single, selected spectra
#'   depending on their total signal or highest signal. Parameter `msLevel`
#'   allows to define from which MS level spectra should be extracted,
#'   parameter `method` allows to define if all or selected spectra should
#'   be returned. See [chromPeakSpectra()] for details.
#'
#' - `dropChromPeaks`: removes (all) chromatographic peak detection results
#'   from `object`. This will also remove any correspondence results (i.e.
#'   features) and eventually present adjusted retention times from the object
#'   if the alignment was performed **after** the peak detection.
#'   Alignment results (adjusted retention times) can be retained if parameter
#'   `keepAdjustedRtime` is set to `TRUE`.
#'
#' - `dropFilledChromPeaks`: removes chromatographic peaks added by gap filling
#'   with `fillChromPeaks`.
#'
#' - `fillChromPeaks`: perform *gap filling* to integrate signal missing
#'   values in samples in which no chromatographic peak was found. This
#'   depends on correspondence results, hence `groupChromPeaks` needs to be
#'   called first. For details and options see [fillChromPeaks()].
#'
#' - `findChromPeaks`: perform chromatographic peak detection. See
#'   [findChromPeaks()] for details.
#'
#' - `hasChromPeaks`: whether the object contains peak detection results.
#'   Parameter `msLevel` allows to check whether peak detection results are
#'   available for the specified MS level(s).
#'
#' - `hasFilledChromPeaks`: whether gap-filling results (i.e., filled-in
#'   chromatographic peaks) are present.
#'
#' - `manualChromPeaks`: *manually* add chromatographic peaks by defining
#'   their m/z and retention time ranges. See [manualChromPeaks()] for
#'   details and examples.
#'
#' - `plotChromPeakImage`: show the *density* of identified chromatographic
#'   peaks per file along the retention time. See [plotChromPeakImage()] for
#'   details.
#'
#' - `plotChromPeaks`: indicate identified chromatographic peaks from one
#'   sample in the RT-m/z space. See [plotChromPeaks()] for details.
#'
#' - `refineChromPeaks`: *refines* identified chromatographic peaks in `object`.
#'   See [refineChromPeaks()] for details.
#'
#' @section Functionality related to alignment:
#'
#' - `adjustedRtime`: extract adjusted retention times. This is just an
#'   alias for `rtime(object, adjusted = TRUE)`.
#'
#' - `adjustRtime`: performs retention time adjustment (alignment) of the data.
#'   See [adjustRtime()] for details.
#'
#' - `applyAdjustedRtime`: replaces the original (raw) retention times with the
#'   adjusted ones. See [applyAdjustedRtime()] for more information.
#'
#' - `dropAdjustedRtime`: drops alignment results (adjusted retention time) from
#'   the result object. This also reverts the retention times of identified
#'   chromatographic peaks if present in the result object. Note that any
#'   results from a correspondence analysis (i.e. feature definitions) will be
#'   dropped too (if the correspondence analysis was performed **after** the
#'   alignment). This can be overruled with `keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE`.
#'
#' - `hasAdjustedRtime`: whether alignment was performed on the object (i.e.,
#'   the object contains alignment results).
#'
#' - `plotAdjustedRtime`: plot the alignment results; see [plotAdjustedRtime()]
#'   for more information.
#'
#' @section Functionality related to correspondence analysis:
#'
#' - `dropFeatureDefinitions`: removes any correspondence analysis results from
#'   `object` as well as any filled-in chromatographic peaks. By default
#'   (with parameter `keepAdjustedRtime = FALSE`) also all alignment results
#'   will be removed if alignment was performed **after** the correspondence
#'   analysis. This can be overruled with `keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE`.
#'
#' - `featureArea`: returns a `matrix` with columns `"mzmin"`, `"mzmax"`,
#'   `"rtmin"` and `"rtmax"` with the m/z and retention time range for each
#'   feature (row) in `object`. By default these represent the minimal m/z
#'   and retention times as well as maximal m/z and retention times for
#'   the chromatographi peaks assigned to that feature. Note that if in
#'   one sample more than one chromatographic peak is assigned to a feature
#'   only the one with the higher intensity is considered. Parameter
#'   `features` allows to extract these values for selected features only.
#'   Parameters `mzmin`, `mzmax`, `rtmin` and `rtmax` allow to define
#'   the function to calculate the reported `"mzmin"`, `"mzmax"`, `"rtmin"`
#'   and `"rtmax"` values.
#'
#' - `featureChromatograms`: extract ion chromatograms (EICs) for each
#'   feature in `object`. See [featureChromatograms()] for more details.
#'
#' - `featureDefinitions`: returns a `data.frame` with feature definitions or
#'   an empty `data.frame` if no correspondence analysis results are present.
#'   Parameters `msLevel`, `mz`, `ppm` and `rt` allow to define subsets of
#'   feature definitions that should be returned with the parameter `type`
#'   defining how these parameters should be used to subset the returned
#'   `data.frame`. See parameter descriptions for details.
#'
#' - `featureSpectra`: returns a [Spectra()] or `List` of `Spectra` with
#'   (MS1 or MS2) spectra associated to each feature. See [featureSpectra()]
#'   for more details and available parameters.
#'
#' - `featuresSummary`: calculate a simple summary on features. See
#'   [featureSummary()] for details.
#'
#' - `groupChromPeaks`: performs the correspondence analysis (i.e., grouping
#'   of chromatographic peaks into LC-MS *features*). See [groupChromPeaks()]
#'   for details.
#'
#' - `hasFeatures`: whether correspondence analysis results are presentin in
#'   `object`. The optional parameter `msLevel` allows to define the  MS
#'   level(s) for which it should be determined if feature definitions are
#'   available.
#'
#' - `overlappingFeatures`: identify features that overlapping or close in
#'   m/z - rt dimension. See [overlappingFeatures()] for more information.
#'
#' @section Extracting data and results from an `XcmsExperiment`:
#'
#' Preprocessing results can be extracted using the following functions:
#'
#' - `chromPeaks`: extract identified chromatographic peaks. See section on
#'   chromatographic peak detection for details.
#'
#' - `featureDefinitions`: extract the definition of *features* (chromatographic
#'   peaks grouped across samples). See section on correspondence analysis for
#'   details.
#'
#' - `featureValues`: extract a `matrix` of *values* for features from each
#'   sample (file). Rows are features, columns samples. Which *value* should be
#'   returned can be defined with parameter `value`, which can be any column of
#'   the `chromPeaks` matrix. By default (`value = "into"`) the integrated
#'   chromatographic peak intensities are returned. With parameter `msLevel` it
#'   is possible to extract values for features from certain MS levels.
#'   During correspondence analysis, more than one chromatographic peak per
#'   sample can be assigned to the same feature (e.g. if they are very close in
#'   retention time). Parameter `method` allows to define the strategy to deal
#'   with such cases: `method = "medret"`: report the value from the
#'   chromatographic peak with the apex position closest to the feautre's
#'   median retention time. `method = "maxint"`: report the value from the
#'   chromatographic peak with the largest signal (parameter `intensity` allows
#'   to define the column in `chromPeaks` that should be selected; defaults to
#'   `intensity = "into"). `method = "sum"`: sum the values for all
#'   chromatographic peaks assigned to the feature in the same sample.
#'
#' - `quantify`: extract the correspondence analysis results as a
#'   [SummarizedExperiment()]. The feature *values* are used as `assay` in
#'   the returned `SummarizedExperiment`, `rowData` contains the
#'   `featureDefinitions` (without column `"peakidx"`) and `colData` the
#'   `sampleData` of `object`. Additional parameters to the `featureValues`
#'   function (that is used to extract the feature value matrix) can be
#'   passed *via* `...`.
#'
#' @section Visualization:
#'
#' - `plot`: plot for each file the position of individual peaks in the m/z -
#'   retention time space (with color-coded intensity) and a base peak
#'   chromatogram. This function should ideally be called only on a data subset
#'   (i.e. after using `filterRt` and `filterMz` to restrict to a region of
#'   interest). Parameter `msLevel` allows to define from which MS level the
#'   plot should be created. If `x` is a `XcmsExperiment` with available
#'   identified chromatographic peaks, also the region defining the peaks
#'   are indicated with a rectangle. Parameter `peakCol` allows to define the
#'   color of the border for these rectangles.
#'
#' - `plotAdjustedRtime`: plot the alignment results; see [plotAdjustedRtime()]
#'   for more information.
#'
#' - `plotChromPeakImage`: show the *density* of identified chromatographic
#'   peaks per file along the retention time. See [plotChromPeakImage()] for
#'   details.
#'
#' - `plotChromPeaks`: indicate identified chromatographic peaks from one
#'   sample in the RT-m/z space. See [plotChromPeaks()] for details.
#'
#' @section General functionality and functions for backward compatibility:
#'
#' - `uniqueMsLevels`: returns the unique MS levels of the spectra in `object`.
#'
#' The functions listed below ensure compatibility with the *older*
#' [XCMSnExp()] xcms result object.
#'
#' - `fileNames`: returns the original data file names for the spectra data.
#'   Ideally, the `dataOrigin` or `dataStorage` spectra variables from the
#'   object's `spectra` should be used instead.
#'
#' - `fromFile`: returns the file (sample) index for each spectrum within
#'   `object`. Generally, subsetting by sample using the `[` is the preferred
#'    way to get spectra from a specific sample.
#'
#' - `processHistory`: returns a `list` with [ProcessHistory] *process history*
#'   objects that contain also the parameter object used for the different
#'   processings. Optional parameter `type` allows to query for specific
#'   processing steps.
#'
#' - `rtime`: extract retention times of the **spectra** from the
#'   `MsExperiment` or `XcmsExperiment` object. It is thus a shortcut for
#'   `rtime(spectra(object))` which would be the preferred way to extract
#'   retention times from an `MsExperiment`. The `rtime` method for
#'   `XcmsExperiment` has an additional parameter `adjusted` which allows to
#'   define whether adjusted retention times (if present - `adjusted = TRUE`)
#'   or *raw* retention times (`adjusted = FALSE`) should be returned. By
#'   default adjusted retention times are returned if available.
#'
#' @section Differences compared to the [XCMSnExp()] object:
#'
#' - Subsetting by `[` supports arbitrary ordering.
#'
#' @param adjusted For `rtime,XcmsExperiment`: whether adjusted or *raw*
#'     retention times should be returned. The default is to return adjusted
#'     retention times, if available.
#'
#' @param aggregationFun For `chromatogram`: `character(1)` defining the
#'     function that should be used to *aggregate* intensities for retention
#'     time (i.e. each spectrum) along the specified m/z range (parameter
#'     `mz`). Defaults to `aggregationFun = "sum"` and hence all intensities
#'     will be summed up. Alternatively, use `aggregationFun = "max"` to use
#'     the maximal intensity per m/z range to create a base peak
#'     chromatogram (BPC).
#'
#' @param BPPARAM For `chromatogram`: parallel processing setup. Defaults
#'     to `BPPARAM = bpparam()`. See [bpparam()] for more information.
#'
#' @param chromPeaks For `chromatogram`: `character(1)` defining which
#'     chromatographic peaks should be returned. Can be either
#'     `chromPeaks = "apex_within"` (default) to return all chromatographic
#'     peaks with the m/z and RT of their apex within the m/z and retention
#'     time window, `chromPeaks = "any"` for all chromatographic peaks that
#'     are overlapping with the m/z - retention time window or
#'     `chromPeaks = "none"` to not include any chromatographic peaks. See
#'     also parameter `type` below for additional information.
#'
#' @param chunkSize For `chromatogram`: `integer(1)` defining the number of
#'     files from which the data should be loaded at a time into memory.
#'     Defaults to `chunkSize = 2L`.
#'
#' @param drop For `[`: ignored.
#'
#' @param features For `filterFeatureDefinitions` and `featureArea`: `logical`,
#'     `integer` or `character` defining the features to keep or from which
#'     to extract the feature are, respectively. See function description
#'     for more information.
#'
#' @param file For `filterFile`: `integer` with the indices of the samples
#'     (files) to which the data should be subsetted.
#'
#' @param filled For `featureValues`: `logical(1)` specifying whether values
#'     for filled-in peaks should be reported. For `filled = TRUE` (the
#'     default) filled peak values are returned, otherwise `NA` is reported
#'     for the respective features in the samples in which no peak was
#'     detected.
#'
#' @param i For `[`: `integer` or `logical` defining the samples/files to
#'     subset.
#'
#' @param include For `chromatogram`: deprecated; use parameter `chromPeaks`
#'      instead.
#'
#' @param intensity For `featureValues`: `character(1)` specifying the name
#'     of the column in the `chromPeaks(objects)` matrix containing the
#'     intensity value of the peak that should be used for the conflict
#'     resolution if `method = "maxint"`.
#'
#' @param isFilledColumn For `chromPeaks`: `logical(1)` whether a column
#'     `"is_filled"` should be included in the returned `matrix` with the
#'     information whether a peak was detected or *only* filled-in. Note that
#'     this information is also provided in the `chromPeakData` data frame.
#'
#' @param j For `[`: not supported.
#'
#' @param keep For `filterChromPeaks`: `logical`, `integer` or `character`
#'     specifying which chromatographic peaks to keep. If `logical` the
#'     length of `keep` needs to match the number of rows of `chromPeaks`.
#'     Alternatively, `keep` allows to specify the `index` (row) of peaks
#'     to keep or their ID (i.e. row name in `chromPeaks`).
#'
#' @param keepFeatures for most subsetting functions (`[`, `filterFile`):
#'     `logical(1)`: wheter eventually present feature definitions should
#'     be retained in the returned (filtered) object.
#'
#' @param keepAdjustedRtime `logical(1)`: whether adjusted retention times (if
#'     present) should be retained.
#'
#' @param method For `featureValues`: `character(1)` specifying the method to
#'     resolve multi-peak mappings within the same sample (correspondence
#'     analysis can assign more than one chromatographic peak within a sample
#'     to the same feature, e.g. if they are close in retention time). Options:
#'     `method = "medret"`: report the value for the chromatographic peak
#'     closest to the feature's median retention time.
#'     `method = "maxint"`: report the value for the chromatographic peak
#'     with the largest signal (parameter `intensity` allows to select the
#'     column in `chromPeaks` that should be used for *signal*).
#'     `method = "sum"`: sum the value for all chromatographic peaks in a
#'     sample assigned to the same feature. The default is `method = "medret"`.
#'     For `filterChromPeaks`: currently only `method = "keep"` is supported.
#'
#' @param missing For `featureValues`: default value for missing values.
#'     Allows to define the value that should be reported for a missing peak
#'     intensity. Defaults to `missing = NA_real_`.
#'
#' @param msLevel `integer` defining the MS level (or multiple MS level if the
#'     function supports it).
#'
#' @param msLevel. For `filterRt`: ignored. `filterRt` will always filter
#'     by retention times on all MS levels regardless of this parameter.
#'     For `chromatogram`: `integer` with the MS level from which the
#'     chromatogram(s) should be extracted. Has to be either of length 1 or
#'     length equal to the numer of rows of the parameters `mz` and `rt`
#'     defining the m/z and rt regions from which the chromatograms should
#'     be created. Defaults to `msLevel = 1L`.
#'
#' @param mz For `chromPeaks` and `featureDefinitions`: `numeric(2)` optionally
#'     defining the m/z range for which chromatographic peaks or feature
#'     definitions should be returned. The full m/z range is used by default.
#'     For `chromatogram`: two-column numerical `matrix` with each row
#'     representing m/z range that should be aggregated into a chromatogram.
#'     If not provided the full m/z range of the data will be used (and hence
#'     a total ion chromatogram will be returned if `aggregationFun = "sum"`
#'     is used).
#'
#' @param mzmax For `featureArea`: function to calculate the `"mzmax"` of
#'     a feature based on the `"mzmax"` values of the individual
#'     chromatographic peaks assigned to that feature. Defaults to
#'     `mzmax = max`.
#'
#' @param mzmin For `featureArea`: function to calculate the `"mzmin"` of
#'     a feature based on the `"mzmin"` values of the individual
#'     chromatographic peaks assigned to that feature. Defaults to
#'     `mzmin = min`.
#'
#' @param peakCol For `plot`: defines the border color of the rectangles
#'     indicating the identified chromatographic peaks. Only a single color
#'     is supported. Defaults to `peakCol = "#ff000060".
#'
#' @param ppm For `chromPeaks` and `featureDefinitions`: optional `numeric(1)`
#'     specifying the ppm by which the m/z range (defined by `mz` should be
#'     extended. For a value of `ppm = 10`, all peaks within `mz[1] - ppm / 1e6`
#'     and `mz[2] + ppm / 1e6` are returned.
#'
#' @param object An `XcmsExperiment` object.
#'
#' @param return.type For `chromPeakData`: `character(1)` defining the
#'     class of the returned object. Can be either `"DataFrame"` (the default)
#'     or `"data.frame"`. For `chromatogram`: `character(1)` defining the
#'     type of the returned object. Currently only
#'     `return.type = "MChromatograms"` is supported.
#'
#' @param rt For `chromPeaks` and `featureDefinitions`: `numeric(2)` defining
#'     the retention time range for which chromatographic peaks or features
#'     should be returned. The full range is used by default.
#'     For `chromatogram`: two column numerical `matrix` with each row
#'     representing the lower and upper retention time window(s) for the
#'     chromatograms. If not provided the full retention time range is used.
#'
#' @param rtmax For `featureArea`: function to calculate the `"rtmax"` of
#'     a feature based on the `"rtmax"` values of the individual
#'     chromatographic peaks assigned to that feature. Defaults to
#'     `rtmax = max`.
#'
#' @param rtmin For `featureArea`: function to calculate the `"rtmin"` of
#'     a feature based on the `"rtmin"` values of the individual
#'     chromatographic peaks assigned to that feature. Defaults to
#'     `rtmin = min`.
#'
#' @param type For `chromPeaks` and `featureDefinitions` and only if either
#'     `mz` and `rt` are defined too: `character(1)`: defining which peaks
#'     (or features) should be returned. For `type = "any"`: returns all
#'     chromatographic peaks or features also only partially overlapping any of
#'     the provided ranges. For `type = "within"`: returns only peaks or
#'     features completely within the region defined by `mz` and/or `rt`.
#'     For `type = "apex_within"`: returns peaks or features for which the m/z
#'     and retention time of the peak's apex is within the region defined by
#'     `mz` and/or `rt`.
#'     For `processHistory`: restrict returned processing steps to specific
#'     types. Use [processHistoryTypes()] to list all supported values.
#'
#' @param value For `featureValues`: `character(1)` defining which value should
#'     be reported for each feature in each sample. Can be any column of the
#'     `chromPeaks` matrix or `"index"` if simply the index of the assigned
#'     peak should be returned. Defaults to `value = "into"` thus the
#'     integrated peak area is reported.
#'
#' @param x An `XcmsExperiment` object.
#'
#' @param y For `plot`: should not be defined as it is not supported.
#'
#' @param ... Additional optional parameters. For `quantify`: any parameter
#'     for the `featureValues` call used to extract the feature value matrix.
