added fillPeaks.mean
findPeaks.centWave: generates a warning if data seems to be not in centroid mode 
remove global variables in .group.mzClust

Passing more MSn related slots to xcmsRaw
Added findPeaks.MS1(), which simply returns Peaks reported as precursorIon

Pass further parameters down to findPeaks-MSW
Moved Meta-Data for MSn to xcmsRaw object and changed MSn to all-vectors 
	
2007-11-21: 1.11.9
enhanced xcmsRaw() to read MSn spectra
Fixed a typo in protocol code

2007-11-13: 1.10.6 & 1.11.8
Removed unnecessary use of data.frame in findPeaks.centWave(), this fixes
a long delay when large peaklists are generated

2007-11-12: 1.10.5 & 1.11.7
Increased buffer size in findMZBoxes() to catch a rare bug

2007-11-08: 1.10.4 & 1.11.6

Fixed a serious fillPeaks() bug introduced in version 1.9.5, which caused it to
silently fill in zero intensities for almost every missing peak

2007-11-01: 1.10.2 & 1.11.4
Fixed bug in findPeaks.centWave() buffer initialisation (mzboxes.c)
Added check in findPeaks.matchedFilter() for not picking filter artefacts

2007-10-24: 1.11.3
Add generics for provides/requires for protocol dependency checking. 
This was inspired by the init script system for Gentoo Linux. Add 
Summarize step to pipeline, which is responsible for reducing a 
component (a set of peaks) to a single quantity. 

Add protocol types for profile filtering, component finding, grouping, 
retention time correction, peak filling, normalization and 
identification. The median is used as the default profile filter. 
Baseline subtraction is supported through a wrapper "subtract" protocol 
that subtracts a filter result from the original matrix.

2007-10-09: 1.10.1 & 1.11.2
Added error when xcmsRaw objects are read that have non-monotonic stantimes
Added warning when retcor() is probably overcorrecting
Fixed a bounds checking bug in specPeaks()

2007-10-07: 1.11.1
Add xcmsPipeline framework, make naming of range parameters
consistent, add rawMat() method for generating a "raw"
(time,mz,intensity) matrix and allow a matrix (multiple factors) in
experimental design.

Bugfix for MSW.getRidge

2007-09-04: 1.9.5
Fixed bug were fillPeaks() would fail if there was <= 1 peak to fill in
Made getPeaks() slightly more memory efficient by correcting an oversight
flush.console() is now called on all systems during long operations

2007-07-16: 1.9.4
Increased buffer size to 100000 in findMZBoxes() to handle also files with a vast number of peaks
Fixed bug in MSW.getRidge() to catch empty ridgeLists
findPeaks.centWave
  - The scale on which the peak was localised is also returned
  - additional logical argument fitgauss, gaussian fits are no longer mandatory 
  - Integration method can be choosen: descent on the mexican hat filtered data or on the real data. Method 2 is honest, 
    while method 1 (default) is more robust to noise.
  - runs much faster
